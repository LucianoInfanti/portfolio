## To do

- Dark Mode
- Pass all data to `Data.json`
- Take a pass at all animations and standardize motion tokens
- Create the `<Image/>`component and its variations
- Figure it out how to render `.mp4` files on web
- Mobile

## To consider

- Add `<NavLink/>` as a `prop` to the header component so I can remove it from the article page (?)
- Is it possible to add the like counter without a back-end
- Flip interaction for links
- Cool hover for images
- Show image on hover @ /Writing
- Add Work / About pages
- Add https://codesandbox.io/s/ro92c5?file=/fragmentShader.js&from-sandpack=true

## Done

- ~~ "Active Route" trought React Router (possibly using `<NavLink>`) ~~
- ~~When start to scroll hide 'Writing'~~
- ~~- Review the z-index in the article page ~~
- ~~Review the stagger animation, it looks wrong, the timmings are most likely off~~
- ~~Find a hook to avoid rendering `<Header/>` multiple times~~
